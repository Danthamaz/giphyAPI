# giphyAPI

This application demonstrates my ability to use APIs. Using the giphy API I was able to allow users to search the Giphy database for 
any type of GIF the user desires.

In the future I plan on connecting this to a database so that the new buttons created are saved to the page for other users to access.

To save on memory and space I would set a limit on this feature to only 10 buttons or so, that way the page is not overwhelmed with options.
